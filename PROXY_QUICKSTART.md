# 🚀 Proxy Quick Start (5 Minutes)

## Step 1: Get Free Proxies (for testing)
Go to: https://free-proxy-list.com/
- Find proxies with "✓" in "Last Checked" column (recently working)
- Copy 5-10 proxy URLs
- Example: `http://123.45.67.89:8080`

## Step 2: Open Proxy Manager in App
1. Click the **"🔗 Proxy Manager"** tab in the app
2. You'll see a clean interface with add proxy section

## Step 3: Add Your First Proxy
1. Paste proxy URL in the box: `http://123.45.67.89:8080`
2. Make sure "http" is selected (not socks5)
3. Click **"Test Proxy"** 
   - Wait a moment (may take 5 seconds)
   - Shows ✓ WORKING or ✗ FAILED
4. If working, click **"Add Proxy"**

## Step 4: Add More Proxies (Optional but Recommended)
Repeat step 3 for 4-9 more proxies
- More proxies = better rotation = higher success rate
- Don't add proxies that failed testing

## Step 5: Start Scraping
1. Go to **"🟢 Job Scraper"** tab
2. Enter keywords: `Python developer`
3. Enter locations: `New York, Los Angeles`
4. Make sure DuckDuckGo is checked (or other engine)
5. Click **"Start Scraping"** 
6. App automatically rotates through your proxies!

## Expected Results
- ✅ Should find job listings now
- ✅ Even with free proxies, many queries work
- ✅ If still blocked, try paid proxies

## Proxy Issues?

**"✗ FAILED" when testing:**
- Proxy is dead or banned
- Try a different proxy from the list

**Still getting "No results found":**
- DuckDuckGo might still be blocking
- Try these solutions:
  1. Add more proxies (5-10 minimum)
  2. Try paid proxies (Smartproxy, etc.)
  3. Try a different search engine (Startpage)
  4. Wait a few hours and retry

**App running slow:**
- Normal with proxies (adds latency)
- Free proxies are slowest
- Paid proxies are faster

## Paid Proxy Recommendation
If free proxies don't work well:
- **Smartproxy.com** ($5/month)
  - Easy setup
  - Reliable
  - Good for scraping

Just get your proxy URL from them and add it the same way!

**That's it! You're now set up to bypass blocks with proxies! 🎉**
